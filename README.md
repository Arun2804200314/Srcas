De-Smoking-De-Hazing-Algorithm
This project is a Python implementation of a single image dehazing algorithm. The purpose of the code is to enhance the visibility of images that are affected by atmospheric haze or fog. The dehazing process involves estimating the atmospheric light, calculating the transmission map, and then using this information to remove the haze from the original image.
